      <description>My wife and I enjoying a sunny day at Vi√±a del Mar, Chile
Hi! My name is Miguel Biron Lattes and this is my blog (hence, MBLog). I am a financial stability analyst at the Superintendency of Banks and Financial Instritutions of Chile (SBIF). Before coming to SBIF, I completed a masters degree in statistics at Columbia University. Prior to that, I worked as a financial engineering analyst at CLGroup Financial Services Consulting.</description>
