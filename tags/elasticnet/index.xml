      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s crazy how fast this first term went by! But I loved it. The Department of Statistics at UBC is insanely awesome. The people are the best, from students to faculty and staff. The academic environment is very stimulating, especially in my area of interest, with lots of active reading groups and frequent seminars related to Bayesian Statistics, Probabilistic Models and Statistical Learning. We even had the privilege of attending a talk by the expert in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo &lt;a href=&#34;https://betanalpha.github.io/&#34;&gt;Michael Betancourt&lt;/a&gt;. We also have lots of interaction with people from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~fwood/&#34;&gt;Frank Wood&lt;/a&gt;’s group at the CS department. And finally, the UBC Vancouver campus is so beautiful! Definitely worth a visit if you happen to be in the city (which also deserves to be visited in itself!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
