      <description>In this post, I will give a brief description of real valued Fourier series in higher dimensions, with some neat plots. I started reading about Fourier series because in the 1D case they are useful for extracting periodic patterns from time series data. However, I ended up fascinated by the pretty pictures one could get by plotting random 2D series, or by the periodic videos made by “walking” along a 3D space “painted”&amp;quot; with a Fourier series.</description>

      <description>Update: I have built a demo webapp implementing the solution presented here. You should try it!
Imagine you have a group of $n$ friends and that you regularly go out for drinks with them (say, a couple of times a week). At each of these meetings, a different member of the group pays for the bill, but you keep track of who consumed what (by using one of these popular apps, for example).</description>
