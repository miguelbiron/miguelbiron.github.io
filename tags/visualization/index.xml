      <description>In this post, I will give a brief description of real valued Fourier series in higher dimensions, with some neat plots. I started reading about Fourier series because in the 1D case they are useful for extracting periodic patterns from time series data. However, I ended up fascinated by the pretty pictures one could get by plotting random 2D series, or by the periodic videos made by “walking” along a 3D space “painted”&amp;quot; with a Fourier series.</description>
