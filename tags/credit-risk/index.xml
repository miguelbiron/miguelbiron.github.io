      <description>I just released a package on Github called BIDC, which stands for Bayesian Inference for Default Correlations. I started working on this together with my colleague Victor Medina back when I was a financial stability analyst at the Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institutions in Chile. In fact, you can see the slides from our presentation at the 2017 version of SBIF conference here.
Description BIDC is a package that aims to provide multiple tools for performing Bayesian inference on the default correlation of a given portfolio, along with any other latent factor.</description>
